# Feather_Thermo_Reader
A portable thermocouple reader based on an Adafruit 32u4 Feather with Oled Featherwing, and using the MAX31850T thermocouple reader


basically a clone of the temperature measurement part of the vertical sample holder heater PID controller logic, but in a portable hand-held form factor which simply displays the temperature as it measures it
